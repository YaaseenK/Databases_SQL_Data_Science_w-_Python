-- Practice Questions: 
-- 1. Retrieve the list of all employees, first and last names, whose first names start with ‘S’.
    SELECT F_NAME, L_NAME
    FROM EMPLOYEES
    WHERE F_NAME LIKE 'S%'

-- 2. Arrange all the records of the EMPLOYEES table in ascending order of the date of birth.
    SELECT * from EMPLOYEES 
    ORDER BY B_DATE;

-- 3. Group the records in terms of the department IDs and filter them of ones that have average salary more than or equal to 60000. Display the department ID and the average salary.
    SELECT DEP_ID, AVG(SALARY)
    FROM EMPLOYEES
    GROUP BY DEP_ID
    HAVING count(*) <= 60000
    -- ORDER BY SALARY;

-- 4. For the problem above, sort the results for each group in descending order of average salary.
